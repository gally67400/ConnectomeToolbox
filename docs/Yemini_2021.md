**Summary**

- Identified brainwide expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for ACh, GABA, and Glu completing a map of this communication network
- Uncover changes in cell fate caused by TF mutations
- Record brainwide activity in response to attractive and repulsive chemosensory cues, characterizing multimodal coding for these stimuli
- This data was used by Ripoll-Sanchez et al. (2023) to generate the neuropeptidergic connectome.
