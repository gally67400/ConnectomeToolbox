**Abstract:**
- Hermaphrodite nervous system consists of 302 neurons arranged in an invariant structure.
- There are 118 classes, 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 NMJs and 600 gap junctions.
- Look at appendix 2 for minor ambiguities (*link to be inserted*)

**Reliability of data**
1. Human error: when following long featureless process bundles, it resulted in switch processes.
2. Many processes run close to plane of sectioning and so it provides images with indistinct objects leading to problems in identification
3. Similar errors of process identification in area of poor image quality caused by dirt or loss of sections on grid bars

**Nervous System**
- Organised into 302 neurons consisting of 118 classes (class size ranges from 1 to 13)

_Sensory transduction_
- sensilla (sense organs): containe one or a number of ciliated nerve endings and 2 non-neuronal cells (sheath and socket cell)
- socket cell: interfacial hypodermal cell acting to join the sensilum to the hypodermis
- sheath cell: (defined extracellular mileu for receptor endings). It is a glial-like cell that envelops the endings of neurons.
