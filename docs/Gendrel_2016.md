**Abstract**

- Reports a comprehensive neurotransmitter map of neurons in the _C.elegans_ connectome revealing twice as many GABA-positive neuron classes as previously reported.
- This data was later used and incorporated into <a href='../Bentley_2016/'>Bentley et al. 2016</a> multilayer connectome and <a href='../Randi_2023'>Randi et al. 2023</a> functional connectome.
