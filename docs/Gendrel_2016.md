**Abstract**

- They report a comprehensive neurotransmitter map of neurons in the _C.elegans_ connectome revealing twice as many GABA-positive neuron classes as previously reported.
- This data was later used and incorporated into Bentley et al. (2016) multilayer connectome and Randi et al. (2023) functional connectome.
